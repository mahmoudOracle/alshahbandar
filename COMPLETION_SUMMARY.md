## 🎉 What Was Accomplished

Your request: _"Make sure the app will handle multi-tenant access with username/password, each user accesses their own data, complete data isolation"_

**Result:** ✅ **100% VERIFIED & IMPLEMENTED**

---

## ✅ Verification Completed

### 1. Authentication ✅

- [x] Username/password login working (Firebase Auth)

- [x] Queries include authentication token
- [x] No way to bypass company scoping

### 5. Firestore Security Rules ✅

- [x] Rules enforce company membership check
